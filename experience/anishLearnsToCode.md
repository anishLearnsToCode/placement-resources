Hi, I studied Mathematics and Computing from the Delhi Technological University ðŸŽ“ and during that time I explored
many different things including competitive programming, web Development and am currently getting my hands dirty 
with Machine Learning. (who isn't??)

I practiced algorithms and data structures extensively and almost exclusively from 
[HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms) 
and you can check out links to all the Hackerrank problems I have solved over 
[here](https://github.com/anishLearnsToCode/competitive-programming).

Before the placement season I also solved a few questions of the 
[Leetcode algorithms](https://leetcode.com/problemset/algorithms)
domain whose solutions can be viewed [here](https://github.com/anishLearnsToCode/leetcode-algorithms).

In 2018 I was selected as a Technical Student at CERN and worked there as a full stack software developer. 
Before CERN, I worked at Coding Ninjas, Delhi as a Java Teaching Assistant and even today I am a tutor at What
After College and teach Java and Python to students.

In the on campus placements I was shortlisted and selected by Zomato. Following are the questions that I remember 
from my interview rounds:

## Zomato
### Round 1
In this round I showed the interviewer my projects and and the interviewer asked me questions related to those
projects such as te tools and frameworks I used to build them and the pipeline I used to deploy them. 
No other questions were asked of me in this round.

### Round 2
In this round my interview was taken by the VP of Technology @ Zomato Mr. Ram Singla and this was 
definitely a pretty interesting round. We started of with simply him perusing through my GitHub page and 
discussing my projects. We then started discussing a particular project and ha discussions on many abstract 
topics such as Clean Code, Refactoring, Abstraction vs. Composition and then we even had a lengthy discussion
on system design and which component should be aware of which procedure/property etc.

He asked me a question on Network Protocols; What are protocol buffers? He also asked me what is an _ORM_ (Object
Relational Mapping). He also asked me how I would create a hierarchical based structure such as a dropdown menu 
with many other dropdown menus in it in SQL.

After these questions we had a generic discussion on what Zomato is, does and it's business model and I believe
at one point I also asked whether there was a Gymnasium on campus ðŸ™ˆðŸ˜›

That was that and surprisingly, I was selected!
